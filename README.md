This is a small demo to show case the basic rotational capabilites of the Navi SDK. It along with the Navi SDK are licensed under GPLv3.

[Download Build Here](https://github.com/vmohan7/NaviPirateDemo/releases/download/v1.0.0/PirateDemov1.0.0.zip)

## How to play

Once you have done the tutorial that is included with the Navi SDK, you will be transported on top of a tower on an island in the middel of the Ocean. Your task is to protect this island from pirates ships. When the game begins, use your device to deflect incoming bombs right back at the ships. The plane you control is also a mirror reflection of what is behind you. Use it to see ships sneaking up from behind. 

## Contributing

I would defintely love to add more features/gameplay to this demo and make it look a lot more polished. If you have suggestions or ideas, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request.
